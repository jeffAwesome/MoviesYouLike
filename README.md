##About Movies You Like
This is a simple application that provides the user with movies they might like based 
on a movie they already like.

Jquery was used to grab the json data and handlebars.js was used to template the received data.

There are several views included.
   related.html
   exactMovie.html (These two views are virtually the same... one just pulls related movies
 based on text the other view is when the actual movie id has been used. The related page is used specifically when a user searches a title of a movie.)
   view.html (This is the actual movie view for the selected movie.)

 This is a pretty early draft of the movie site. I plan to add a lot more to it when i have time.
 Feel free to help.
